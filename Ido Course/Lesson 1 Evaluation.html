<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><i>Before we dive into Ido...</i></span></h2>
<oneline>
<p>We're at a decision point. &nbsp;Many ideas have come up, such as:</p>
<p>1. we all stay with Eo<br>
2. we all go to Ido<br>
3. have two separate classes, one for Eo and one for Ido<br>
4. teach a hybrid language - some features and vocab from Eo, some new
features from Ido</p>
<p>I think there are really only 2 choices - the top two.</p>
<oneline>
<p><b>(3) having two separate classes</b></p>
<p><b>problems:</b></p>
<noline>
<ul>
<li>with this, we have lost something wonderful:</li>
<li>we can learn together, talk together, help each other, write messages
to each other, even groan together</li>
<li>we laugh more together. &nbsp;we make sure we don't get too serious.</li>
<li></li>
<li>we would lose all that. &nbsp;it would be one-to-one. &nbsp;just you
and me. no more helping, writing messages to each other.</li>
<li></li>
<li>and for me, it will be twice the work, preparing for 2 classes, reviewing
2 different homeworks</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">=&gt; I think we really need
to stick together, whichever way we go. &nbsp;all for one and one for all.
&nbsp;Thoughts?</span></p>

<p><b>(4) teaching a hybrid language - some features and vocab from Eo,

<p><b>problems:</b></p>
<noline>
<ul>
<li>what does the hybrid language look like? &nbsp;somehow have a mixture
of Eo and Ido words? &nbsp;or let's say we stick with Eo words, but use
Ido letters? &nbsp;(ch, sh, j, etc). &nbsp;And some of the Ido reforms
- no -j, -n, -jn...</li>
<li>no already-prepared teaching materials - doesn't really work to use
our Eo book and ignore the "-j" and "-n". &nbsp;and Ido materials would
also not work for this hybrid language - it won't have our hybrid words.</li>
<li>we could ignore the teaching books and I could create all the lessons
myself, but:</li>
<li>no dictionary that would ever show our spellings (Eo words with Ido
letters - ch, sh, j, etc)</li>
<li>if we got used to ch, sh, etc. &nbsp;and plural -i, and no -j on adjectives,
and no -n on objects, then:
<ul>
<li>if we tried to read Eo books we would have to mentally translate all
the ĉ, ŝ, ĝ, ĵ, etc, and mentally skip over all the -j &nbsp;-n &nbsp;-jn
&nbsp;endings. &nbsp; same if we listened to Eo recordings.</li>
<li>if we tried to read Ido books, certain Ido-only words would not be
recognizable. &nbsp;if we listen to Ido recordings, same problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
