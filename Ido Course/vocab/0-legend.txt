Legend

words only different due to new alphabet are not marked.

unmarked words - word exists in both Ido and Eo, and means the same, so we can use it


marks on Ido words

+ - Ido word does not exist in Eo so we can use it
* - Ido word exists in Eo and has different meaning, so hmmm?
   
marks on Eo words

+ - Eo word does not exist in Ido so we can use it
* - Eo word exists in Ido and has different meaning, so hmmm?

thus
+ - +   use both. no problem.  they are synonyms.
* -     use Eo
  - *   use Io
* - *   ??
